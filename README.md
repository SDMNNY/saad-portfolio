## Description 
HI!!! Welcome to my Portfolio. 
Nothing much to see yet, but it is a work in progress!
The site will be edited through the bootcamp to be made to look extravagant 
So far the portfolio shows my use of proper html semantics, which is followed by basic level of CSS. 
Please allow me to continuously show you my improvement througout the Columbia Bootcamp.
